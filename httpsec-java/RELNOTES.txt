Buggery!

08/11/2006
    Fixed NullPointerException in HttpsecHeader constructor. Didn't check null input before trying to parse. 50 Hail Turings.

    Need to set HttpURLConnection.instanceFollowRedirect( false ) as default.

    Fixed option parsing ( "-private" ) typo in com.secarta.httpsec.tools.CA

    Need a doc note about ServletResponse.flushBuffer() / ServletResponse.reset() buggering up httpsec filter
        - possibly. Don't understand all the rules.

    doc note about response.sendError() vs response.setStatus()
        - sendError() filter scope ( ie NOT USING THE FECKING FILTER )
